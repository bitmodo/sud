      sud_version_bad: |-
        This Sud environment has specified that it requires the Sud
        version to satisfy the following version requirements:
          %{requirements}
        You are running Sud %{version}, which does not satisfy
        these requirements. Please change your Sud version or update
        the Sudfile to allow this Sud version. However, be warned
        that if the Sudfile has specified another version, it probably has
        good reason to do so, and changing that may cause the environment to
        not function properly.
